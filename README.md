[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/sirun/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/sirun/latest/)

`sirun` (pronounced like "siren") is a tool for taking basic perfomance
measurements of a process covering its entire lifetime. It gets memory and
timing information from the kernel and also allows
[Statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd#usage) messages to be sent to
`udp://localhost:8125` (in the future this will be configurable), and those will
be included in the outputted metrics.

It's intended that this tool be used for shorter-running benchmarks, and not for
long-lived processes that don't die without external interaction. You could
certainly use it for long-lived processes, but that's not where it shines.

## Installation

### Via Cargo

`cargo install sirun`

### From releases

[Release bundles](https://github.com/DataDog/sirun/releases) are provided for
each supported plaform. Extract the binary somewhere and use it.

### From source
